=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Rights - A rights mapper for Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible roles.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin can be used on top of Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible to define fine-grained rights for each role.
Each right has a list of roles that have this right. You can also define that a user has to have all listed roles to
gain that right. This way you can define low-level rights like "create_item" and put that requirement into your routes
definition. This plugin will translate the right requirement into a role requirement and call C<require_all_roles> or 
C<require_any_roles> with those roles.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Configure the rights:

  plugins:
    # sample config for Auth::Extensible:
    Auth::Extensible:
      realms:
        config1:
          provider: Config
          users:
            - user: dave
              pass: supersecret
              roles:
                - Developer
                - Manager
                - BeerDrinker
            - user: bob
              pass: alsosecret
              roles:
                - Tester
    Auth::Extensible::Rights:
      rights:
        create_item:
          - BeerDrinker
          - Tester
          - Manager
        delete_item:
          - [ Manager, Tester ]
        delete_all: Manager

Define that a user must be logged in and have the right to access a route:

    get '/create-item' => require_right create_item => sub { show_create_item_form(); };

=head1 CONTROLLING ACCESS TO ROUTES

=head2 require_right

    post '/delete-item/:id' => require_right delete_item => sub {
        ...
    };

Requires that the user must be logged in as a user who has the specified right. If the user is not 
logged in, they will be redirected to the login page URL. If they are logged in, but do not 
have the required role, they will be redirected to the access denied URL.

If C<disable_roles> configuration option is set to a true value then using "require_role" will 
cause the application to croak on load.
