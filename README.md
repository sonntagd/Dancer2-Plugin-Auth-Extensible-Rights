# Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Rights

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sonntagd/Dancer2-Plugin-Auth-Extensible-Rights.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sonntagd/Dancer2-Plugin-Auth-Extensible-Rights)


## NAME

Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible::Rights - A rights mapper for Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible roles.

## DESCRIPTION

This plugin can be used on top of Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Extensible to define fine-grained rights for each role.
Each right has a list of roles that have this right. You can also define that a user has to have all listed roles to
gain that right. This way you can define low-level rights like "create_item" and put that requirement into your routes
definition. This plugin will translate the right requirement into a role requirement and call `require_all_roles` or 
`require_any_roles` with those roles.

## SYNOPSIS

Configure the rights:

```yaml

  plugins:
    # sample config for Auth::Extensible:
    Auth::Extensible:
      realms:
        config1:
          provider: Config
          users:
            - user: dave
              pass: supersecret
              roles:
                - Developer
                - Manager
                - BeerDrinker
            - user: bob
              pass: alsosecret
              roles:
                - Tester
    Auth::Extensible::Rights:
      rights:
        create_item:
          - BeerDrinker
          - Tester
          - Manager
        delete_item:
          - [ Manager, Tester ]
        delete_all: Manager
```

Define that a user must be logged in and have the right to access a route:

```perl
    get '/create-item' => require_right create_item => sub { show_create_item_form(); };
```

## CONTROLLING ACCESS TO ROUTES

### require_right

```perl
    post '/delete-item/:id' => require_right delete_item => sub {
        ...
    };
```

Requires that the user must be logged in as a user who has the specified right. If the user is not 
logged in, they will be redirected to the login page URL. If they are logged in, but do not 
have the required role, they will be redirected to the access denied URL.

If `disable_roles` configuration option is set to a true value then using `require_right` will 
cause the application to croak on load.
